# Hello World
Simple window with label. Usage of Q_Object.    
For project structure read [this QtArticle](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/cmake-get-started.html).
Note usage of *.ui, where they placed and where they included.    
Structure of project was copied from the Article. It's not exacly what I would do,
but since it's a learning Project I leave it be.
