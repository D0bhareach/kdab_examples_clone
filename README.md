# About
Quick remark about project. I like Rust, but to be software developer means not only
do what I like so I need very quick learn C++ (yes, I do not program on this language,
yet). So far I see that whatever Rust spares developers from in C++ developent world
considered to be OK, but I'm sorry, Rust, I must learn C/C++ too. (and Assembler,
and Zig, and whatever else that I will fancy (Carbon? Cabron?), it's a one of good
things of being unemployed)   
This Repository is a CLONE!! of source code from KDAB. This is learning project and
some of directories I, probably, will not even touch. And some I will, probably make a
total crap of,and that is why I copied the Original instead of  forking it
- to hide my shame.   
For development I use VS Code. As building system I use CMake and would like to
keep it so. In places I may leave it as it is (because I'm lazy).   
### Note
After stea.. copying this source and creating my own repository I see that all
developers which were involved in original project are listed as contributors to this
repository, please, do not be misleaded in thoughts that whatever I do here deserved
attention of so many respected contributors. It's a simple Artifact which would please
my ego and eyes every time I would look at it, nothing more.   
Below is original content of README:
